# Password_project
A group of websites with password-protection.

#Purpose
The goal of this project was to create a set of password-protected websites in such a way that adding new ones 
would be easy.

Superclasses and interfaces make
adding new websites easy, as only the custom functions of the websites
have to be added, and the login system can be inherited using polymorphism from
the Website and Account classes.

#Learning Objectives
With an efficient interface, work can be cut down as similar classes do not have to
be written individually.

By completing this project, I have improved my skills in planning out
superclasses and interfaces, learning how to plan out my classes before
working to minimize repetitive code.
